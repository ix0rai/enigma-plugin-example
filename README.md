## enigma plugin application example

This repository serves as the simplest possible example of applying a plugin using [Enigma](https://github.com/QuiltMC/enigma)'s plugin system. It uses [Quilt Enigma Plugin](https://github.com/QuiltMC/enigma) as the example plugin.

In order for a plugin to be applied in Enigma, it must be on the classpath. This gradle setup is the simplest way to do so.
